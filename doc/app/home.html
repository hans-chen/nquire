<H1>Introduction</H1>
<p>
This documentation should contain all information concerning development of the NQuire.
</p>
<p>
The documentation is under version control so the documentation should 
be up to date with the software (at least when it is labeled).
</p>
<p>
Since this documentation is made with hindsight, it is clearly work-in-progress.
Whe someone does notice someting is missing, it should be added. <br>
BUT: when something can be documented in the code (eg function parameters), 
it should not be documented here.
