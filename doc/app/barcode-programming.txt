== Barcode programming == 

=== Introduction ===

Barcode programming can be used for changing settings in the Nquire.

Simply put a line or multiple lines of cit.conf in a barcode and use
the programming mode of the nquire to make those settings.
The barcode has to be a DataMatrix, QR Code or Code128 (of course it is not 
possible to put much settings in a Code 128 barcode).
For security reasons it is possible to enable a 'security' barcode that has to 
be scanned when a barcode is used to change settings of the Nquire. This has to 
be enabled in the webui, or by a programming barcode.
There is a configurable timeout on the programming mode. After this timeout the 
scanner will resume normal scanning mode.

Upon reading incorrect codes the nquire will sound the error beep and resume 
normal programming mode.

After successful programming the nquire will resume normal programming mode.
*This however does not mean that execution of the settings were successfull!*
For instance: setting the Nquire to dhcp or grps takes some time and can fail,
just like it can fail during power-on of the nquire.

== Codes ==

The following barcodes are used to control the programming state of the enquire:

=== Enter programming mode ===

The display will show:

----
Programming
----

=== Exit programming mode ===

The display will show the configured welcome text.

=== Command codes ===

==== Reboot ====

==== Restore defaults ====

==== Show configuration ====

==== Set serial number ====

It is possible to scan a serial number.
However the scanned serial number is volatile: after reboot the device will
have it's original serial number.

NOTE: this is meant for testing purposes only.

And 2 different serial numbers:

==== Anounce settings ====
