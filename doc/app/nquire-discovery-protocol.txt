== Introduction ==

The Nquire discovery protocol can be used to discover all Nquire devices in a network.

Another function is the get information about the available Nquires.

== Protocol description ==

The protocol is fairly simplistic:

The server has to send an UDP packet to the discovery port (19200) of the Nquire
(using broadcasting on 239.255.255.250 or the actual address of the nquire), 
containing the following text:

----
CIT-DISCOVER-REQUEST
Version: 1
----

In which:

 -	Line breaks can be '\n' (0x0d) or '\n\r' (0x0d0a) or '\r\n'
 -	The first line is a discovery packet identifier. It should
	contain: `CIT-DISCOVER-REQUEST`
	(cit stands for 'customer information terminal').
 -	The second line is the version of the discovery protocol 
	(so this is not the version of the application!)
	It begins with the "`Version:`" string (case sensitive, no space 
	between "`Version`" and "`:`"), followed by exactly 1
	space charracter and the version number "`1`".
	From application version 1.3 on, the protocol is somewhat relaxed: there can 
	be a number of spaces and/or tabs between the ":" and the version number. 

From application version 1.3, the discovery protocol is extended with
an optional line containing: `RESPONSE-TO-SENDER-PORT`.

When this option is used, the response is not broadcasted using the 
discovery port but broadcasted using the port on which the 
`CIT-DISCOVER-REQUEST `packet was send.

The protocol version is not increased because this addition is of no
consequence when not used.

All	Nquires receiving the packet and implementing the sent version will
respond by broadcasting an UDP packet to `239.255.255.250`
port `19200 `or, when `RESPONSE-TO-SENDER-PORT `is 
used, to the sender port of the `CIT-DISCOVER-REQUEST `packet.
The packet will have the following format (BNF):

----
file ::= "CIT-DISCOVER-RESPONSE" EOL <idvalues>
idvalues ::= <idvalue> EOL <idvalues> | <idvalue> EOF
idvalue ::= <identifier> ":" SPACE <value>
SPACE ::= "" | " " SPACE | TAB SPACE
identifier ::= [printable asci not ':']
----

Version 1 of the Nquire discovery protocol will send the following 
packet header and identifier-value pairs (values are an example):

----
CIT-DISCOVER-RESPONSEDevice name: Newland NQuire 200Application version: 1.2Application build nr: 456Serial number: EI0123456RWIP-Address: 192.168.1.226MAC-Address: 08:00:46:31:60:95
----

 -	Note 1: The protocol for a certain version will not change. Any
	change with a consequence for usage of the existing protocol version will
	result in an increased version number in the
	`CIT-DISCOVER-REQUEST `packet.

 -	Note 2: The rational behind using broadcasting is to be able to discover 
	Nquires configured for a different subnet as the server sending the 
	discovery packet.
