<H1>Server communication</H1>
<p>	The nquire server communication is 3 fold (as seen from the server):
<lu>
	<li><a href="nquire-discovery-protocol.html">Discovery</a> of available Nquires on a network</li>
	<li>Receiving scanned barcodes or mifare data</li>
	<li>Showing information on an Nquire.</li>
</lu>
Note that discovery can also be done using the SG15 compatebility.
</p>
<p>
The server communication is done by UDP and/or TCP.
The TCP connection can be in server mode or in client mode.
In server mode the Nquire will listen to connections on the configured TCP port,
whereas in client mode the quire will try to make the connection using the 
configured "remote ip address" and "tcp port".
When there are multiple connections (server mode only), scanned barcode data will
be sent to all connected servers.
</p>
<p>
Putting text on the nquire is done by a (downwards) SG15 compatible protocol: 
the Nquire is able to do more, so the protocol is extended:
<lu>
	<li>The screen is bigger so "set pixel position" allows bigger values.</li>
	<li>"select font set" is extended: values 0x32 to 0x40 represent fonts from
	6px to 96px with steps of 6px.</li>
	<li>For testing purposes there is a 'fake scan' escape code.</li>
</lu>
