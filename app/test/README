== Setup ==

Testing the nquire application:

This is done using scripts or small programs, each testing different parts of 
the application. There are a number of module tests that are able to some 
modules on the development host. The remaining tests are to be done on the 
target.

Each test is a small executable (compiled or script) conforming to:
 - exit 0: no error during test execution
 - exit <>0: execution of the test failed premature
 - the stdout and stderr are redirected to a result-file which is compared with
   a manually verified result file.

The different tests can be found in subdirectories:

module/
target/


Executing the tests can be done using the make file. E.g: the following would
first clean everithing, than build preriquisites, than execute all tests and
show a diff of the results with verified results using meld:
--------
make clobber
make all test show
--------

NOTE: some tests require manual interaction (e.g. for presenting a mifare card
to the nquire)

== manual tests ==

Manually verify whether there are no resource leaks on the target:

[root@NEWLAND_CIT /cit200] (while true; do cat /proc/sys/fs/file-nr; sleep 1; done) &

The first minus the second number of the output represents the number of 
currently opened files.
