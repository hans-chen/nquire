Extra:

 * (almost) everything should be tested by automated test-scripts
 * refactoring: cit.lua needs to get an explicit state machine
 * refactoring: touch16.lua all dependencies to cit.lua should be removed
 * refactoring: end of changing settings should be explicit 
                (not just some timeout as it is now)
 * refactoring: it should be better to use an external http server (add little)
 * refactoring: configuring the internal scanners should be done asynchroneous.
