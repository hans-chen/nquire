first of all, sorry about my poor english.

sg15_rootfs.tar is a usable rootfs for sg15. you can use it through the nfs directly.

some change for cit-0.4-5-g3559f64
1.makefile file
add CROSS = arm-linux-
change: LDFLAGS_dpydrv.so	+= -lungif -lSDL_image  
to :LDFLAGS_dpydrv.so       += -lungif -lSDL_imagei -lrt

2.sg15-test file
change :ADDRESS=172.16.39.10 
to: ADDRESS=127.0.0.1  
define escape code is 27 (0x1b), so we change all the \e to \x1b in this file.

3.nework.lua file
change :local cmd = "ifdown -a && ifup " .. ifname 
to: local cmd = "ifup " .. ifname
just for the nfs debugging

4.scanner.lua file
at the end of the open function we add :scanner:enable() 

5.beepthread.c file
change :l = snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), "\e[10;%.0f]\e[11;%.0f]\x7", freq, duration * 1000);
to :l = snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), "\x1b[10;%.0f]\x1b[11;%.0f]\x7", freq, duration * 1000); 
because now the escape code is 0x1b.

6.schema/device.schema file
change:
default = "240x128m",
range = "240x128m,320x160c",
to:
default = "239x127m",
range = "239x127m,240x128m,320x160c",

7.display.lua file
add one item in the dpyinfo
["239x127m"] = {
	native_font_size = 8,
	virtkbd_size = nil,	-- not enabled
},

note:
1.we don't add the configuration file about the network,gprs,modem now.
2.telenetd is usable   userid: sg15  passwd: sg15
3.webserver is usable.
4.the device can scan the barcode now, but after we get the barcode  a error will be occur.
5.test application is usable, for example sg15-test tcp 1
